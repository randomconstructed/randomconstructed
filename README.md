# Random Constructed

Constructed got less challenging when net decking (looking up well tested decks online) became possible... Random Constructed is a format that attempts to make constructed more interesting taking it back to the good old days where you had to innovate.

Every week, 3 sets are picked at random from which to construct decks and battle. The Bitcoin Cash blockchain is used as a source of unbiased randomness to pick the sets.

Randomness comes from the hash of the first block mined after noon on Sunday. The new week's format is locked in from 4pm GMT on Sunday and lasts exactly one week. A new tweet is posted [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RandomConst) when the sets change. You can also [run the code yourself](https://repl.it/@randomconst/randomconstructed) to see what the current sets.

The number of combinations of three sets from the current 97 in the [set list](https://github.com/randomconstructed/randomconstructed/blob/master/sets.csv) is 147440 so no net decking will be possible :D

Happy building!
