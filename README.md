# Random Constructed

Constructed magic got boring when net decking became possible... Random Constructed is a format that makes constructed interesting again.

Every week, 3 random sets are picked from which to construct decks and battle. The Bitcoin Cash blockchain is used as a source of unbiased randomness.

Randomness comes from the hash of the first block mined after noon on Sunday. The new week's format is locked in from 4pm GMT on Sunday and lasts exactly one week. A new tweet is posted [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RandomConst) when the sets change. You can also [run the code yourself](https://repl.it/@randomconst/randomconstructed) to see what the current sets.

The number of combinations of three sets from the current 95 in the [set list](https://github.com/randomconstructed/randomconstructed/blob/master/sets.csv) is 138415 so no net decking will be possible :D

Happy building!
